# Tech-Blog
A CMS-style blog site similar to Wordpress, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, the express-session npm package for authentication, and is deployed to Heroku.
